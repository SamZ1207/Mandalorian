            The show takes place inbetween Episodes 6 and 7, and follows the story of a mandalorian bounty hunter named Din Djarin, who is also known as "The Mandalorian"or "Mando" in his guild on Navaro.
            On one of his bounties he has to find and retrive "The Child", but we find that the bounty is a baby yoda. When he returns baby yoda back to the guild for his payment; he takes the payment, and breaks into the facility that is holding baby yoda and studying it. He abducts the child and leaves the planet, trying to avoid the hunters of Din's new bounty. The Mandalorian travels to many plants trying to find its species, but isnt able to find other members of the species. After visiting many planets, he returns to Navaro after a plea from the guild master. The guildmaster tell Din that the Empire has returned and has taken over the city.
