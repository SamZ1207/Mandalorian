            Personally I like this show because mandalorians is what the Clone Troopers (and technically Stormtroopers) of the prequals trilogy, and the Clone wars TV show are based off of genetically and its armor.

            In the shows and movies that feature mandalorian characters, they are grouped into clans and operate like Europeans with split cultures, but with similar beliefs and traditions. What sperates the Mandalorian Show from the other mandalorian characters,is that he follows a different creed/rule than the rest of the other mandalorian characters.

            Also I cant forget to menion a popular character, Baby Yoda or Grogu, that was the prized bounty of The Mandalorian, and help develops the chacater, as he shows more emotions towards him than to other characters. Throught the seasons, Din Djarin acts like a father-figure for The Child, which he is further supported when The Child is Abducted in Season 2, and Din Djarin violates his creed to save Grogu.

            Some other things that appealed to me was the characters that it could have included beofre the end of Season 2. In Season 2 there were many new characters, many with great populatritty including Ashoka Tano,(making her live-action debut from the Clone Wars and Rebels TV show), Boba Fett (his fate was unkown after Episode 6), Bo Katan (making her live-action debut from the Clone Wars and Rebels TV show) and unexpectanly Luke Skywalker, making a suspensefull appearance at the end epsode 12
